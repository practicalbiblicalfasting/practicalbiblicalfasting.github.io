## Why Jesus Assumed You Would Fast (And What That Means Today)

*"When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do..."* - Matthew 6:16

Not if you fast. When.

I've been in ministry for 20 years, and that simple word choice still stops me in my tracks. Jesus didn't say "If you decide to try fasting someday" or "For those of you who are super spiritual enough to fast." He said when.

Like it was a given. Like breathing or eating or praying.

But here's what puzzles me: if Jesus assumed His followers would fast, why do most Christians today treat it like an extreme spiritual discipline reserved for monks and mystics?

## The assumption that changed everything

Last month, Sarah (not her real name) sat in my office, tears streaming down her face. "Pastor, I feel so distant from God. I pray, I read my Bible, I go to church, but it's like He's not there anymore."

"Have you ever fasted?" I asked gently.

She looked at me like I'd suggested she climb Mount Everest barefoot. "Oh, I could never do that. I get hangry after skipping breakfast."

Sound familiar?

Here's the thing: Jesus never treated fasting as an advanced spiritual discipline. He assumed it would be as normal as giving to the poor or praying in private. All three appear in the same teaching in Matthew 6, with the same casual expectation.

## What Jesus actually said about fasting

Let's look at what Jesus assumed about fasting:

**He assumed you would do it regularly.** The word "when" in Matthew 6:16 is a present participle in Greek, suggesting ongoing action. Not once in a lifetime, but as a regular practice.

**He assumed you wouldn't make a big show of it.** His concern wasn't whether you'd fast, but whether you'd do it with the right heart. The Pharisees were already fasting - they just missed the point.

**He assumed it would be private and personal.** Like prayer and giving, fasting was meant to be between you and God, not a performance for others.

**He modeled it Himself.** Before His public ministry began, Jesus fasted for 40 days. When facing spiritual warfare, He turned to this ancient discipline.

## Why we've made it harder than Jesus did

I think we've complicated something Jesus kept simple. We've turned fasting into:

- A test of spiritual maturity (it's not)
- A way to earn God's favor (impossible)
- An all-or-nothing proposition (it doesn't have to be)
- Something only "super Christians" do (Jesus assumed everyone would)

Three weeks after our conversation, Sarah tried her first 12-hour fast. Not because she had to, but because she wanted to create space to hear God more clearly.

You know what happened? She texted me that evening: "Pastor, I felt God's presence today in a way I haven't in months. Why didn't anyone tell me it could be this simple?"

## What "when you fast" means for your life

Jesus' assumption changes everything about how we approach fasting:

**It normalizes the practice.** If Jesus assumed you'd fast, maybe it's not as intimidating as you thought. Maybe it's just another way to seek God, like prayer or Bible reading.

**It removes the pressure.** You're not trying to achieve some advanced spiritual state. You're simply following a pattern Jesus expected His followers to practice.

**It focuses on the heart.** Jesus cared more about why you fast than how perfectly you do it. Your motives matter more than your method.

**It makes it accessible.** Jesus didn't give complicated instructions or lengthy requirements. He assumed you'd figure out how to incorporate it into your regular spiritual rhythm.

## But what about my busy life?

"That's easy for Jesus to say," you might be thinking. "He didn't have football practice, board meetings, and meal planning."

Fair point. But here's what I've learned after two decades of helping real people develop real spiritual practices:

Jesus meets you where you are.

The single mom who fasts during her lunch break while her kids are at school. The business executive who chooses a 24-hour period that works with his travel schedule. The college student who fasts between classes.

God doesn't need you to recreate first-century Palestine. He needs you to seek Him in your actual life, with your actual schedule, in your actual circumstances.

## The gentle invitation

Here's what I hear in Jesus' words: an invitation, not a demand.

He's saying, "When you're ready to create space for Me in a deeper way, fasting is one pathway. When you need to hear My voice more clearly, this ancient discipline is available to you. When you want to align your heart with Mine, temporary hunger can remind you of your deeper spiritual hunger."

Notice the gentleness in that. No guilt. No pressure. Just a simple assumption that following Him might naturally include this practice.

Sarah's been fasting monthly for six months now. Not because she has to, but because she's discovered what generations of believers before her knew: sometimes we need to get physically hungry to remember how spiritually hungry we really are.

## Where to start (if you're ready)

If Jesus' assumption resonates with you, here's the beautiful truth: you don't have to figure this out alone.

Start small. Jesus didn't specify the length or type of fast. He just assumed you'd do it.

Maybe that's a 12-hour fast from dinner to lunch the next day. Maybe it's skipping one meal and spending that time in prayer. Maybe it's following a simple guide that walks you through your first experience step by step.

The point isn't perfection. It's seeking.

Jesus assumed you would fast because He knew something we've forgotten: there are some things we only discover when we create space for God in ways that go beyond our normal routine.

Some breakthroughs only come through prayer and fasting.

Some clarity only emerges when we temporarily set aside physical comfort to pursue spiritual connection.

Some voices of God only become audible when we quiet the constant demands of our appetites.

## The question that matters

So here's what I want to ask you, the same question I asked Sarah:

If Jesus assumed you would fast, what's stopping you from starting?

Fear? Busyness? Uncertainty about how to begin?

Those are all valid concerns. But they're not insurmountable obstacles.

What if your next step toward deeper intimacy with God is simpler than you think? What if it's just 12 hours away?

What if Jesus knew what He was talking about when He said "when you fast"?
