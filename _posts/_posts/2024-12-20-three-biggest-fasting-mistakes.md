# The 3 Biggest Fasting Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

In 30 years of ministry, I've seen the same three mistakes crush people's first fasting experiences. The tragic part? Every single one is completely preventable.

But here's what breaks my heart most: after one bad experience, many Christians never try again. They assume fasting "isn't for them" or that they're somehow not spiritual enough.

That's simply not true.

## Mistake #1: Going Too Hard, Too Fast

**The Problem:** Sarah decided to start with a 7-day water fast. By day two, she was dizzy, irritable, and convinced God wasn't speaking because she felt terrible.

**The Reality:** Sarah's body was in shock. She went from eating three meals a day to nothing overnight. Her blood sugar crashed, her energy plummeted, and her ability to focus on spiritual things disappeared entirely.

**The Solution:** Start with 12 hours. Seriously. 

I know it doesn't sound "spiritual" enough. But Jesus didn't measure spirituality by suffering levels. He measured it by heart connection with the Father.

A successful 12-hour fast builds confidence, teaches you how your body responds, and creates a foundation for longer fasts later. Success breeds success.

**Try This Instead:**
- Skip breakfast and lunch
- Break your fast with dinner
- Spend the saved meal times in prayer
- Journal what you experience

## Mistake #2: Fasting Without Purpose

**The Problem:** "I'm fasting because I should" or "It's the new year, so I guess I'll try fasting."

Generic fasting produces generic results.

**The Reality:** Fasting amplifies whatever's in your heart. If you're just going through motions, you'll feel like you're just going through motions—while hungry.

**The Solution:** Get specific before you start.

Before my last fast, I wrote in my journal: "God, I'm struggling to trust You with my son's college decision. I keep trying to control the outcome instead of surrendering it to You. I'm fasting to break this pattern and learn to rest in Your timing."

That focus changed everything. Every hunger pang reminded me why I was fasting. Every prayer time had direction.

**Try This Instead:**
Write down your "why" before you begin:
- What specific area needs God's breakthrough?
- What pattern do you want to break?
- What decision needs clarity?
- What relationship needs healing?

## Mistake #3: Ignoring Your Body's Warning Signs

**The Problem:** "I'm going to push through no matter what. Suffering means it's working."

**The Reality:** God designed your body as His temple. Ignoring legitimate warning signs isn't spiritual—it's dangerous.

I've seen people end up in emergency rooms because they thought dizziness, chest pain, or severe headaches were "part of the process."

They're not.

**The Solution:** Know when to stop.

Fasting should challenge you spiritually, not endanger you physically. There's a difference between normal hunger discomfort and your body saying "something's wrong."

**Stop your fast immediately if you experience:**
- Chest pain or heart palpitations
- Severe dizziness or fainting
- Persistent vomiting
- Signs of dehydration (dark urine, no urination)
- Severe headaches that don't improve with water
- Blood sugar issues (if diabetic)

**Normal fasting experiences include:**
- Hunger pangs (they come and go)
- Some fatigue
- Mild headaches (often from caffeine withdrawal)
- Increased emotional sensitivity
- Heightened spiritual awareness

## The Bigger Picture

Here's what I've learned: God honors sincere hearts more than perfect performance.

Your first fast doesn't need to be Instagram-worthy. It doesn't need to result in visions or profound revelations. It just needs to be sincere.

Start small. Stay focused. Listen to your body.

Most importantly, remember why Jesus assumed you would fast—not to impress Him, but to create space for Him to work in your heart.

*Father, help us approach fasting with wisdom, not just enthusiasm. Give us hearts that seek You genuinely and minds that prepare practically. Show us that our relationship with You isn't measured by how much we can endure, but by how sincerely we can surrender. Teach us to fast in ways that draw us closer to You, not drive us away from You. In Jesus' name, Amen.*
