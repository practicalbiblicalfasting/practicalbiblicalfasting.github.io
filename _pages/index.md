# Welcome to Biblical Fasting Guide

*"When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do..."* - Matthew 6:16

Jesus didn't say **if** you fast. He said **when**.

## For 20 years, I've helped Christians discover what Jesus assumed they would practice.

Biblical fasting isn't about proving anything to God. It's about creating space to hear Him more clearly. Whether you're curious about your first fast or looking to deepen your practice, you'll find biblical, practical guidance here.
