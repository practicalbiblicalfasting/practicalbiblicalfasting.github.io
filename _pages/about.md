# About Pastor Marlon

For 20 years, I've had the privilege of serving in ministry and helping Christians grow deeper in their faith. One of the most transformative practices I've witnessed is biblical fasting - yet it's also one of the most misunderstood.

## My Heart for Biblical Fasting

I've seen too many Christians intimidated by fasting, thinking it's only for "super spiritual" people or that they'll somehow do it wrong. The truth is, Jesus assumed His followers would fast. It's not about perfection - it's about creating space to hear God more clearly.

## What You'll Find Here

This site is designed to make biblical fasting:
- **Accessible** - No matter your experience level
- **Safe** - With proper preparation and guidance  
- **Biblical** - Grounded in Scripture, not trends
- **Practical** - Fitting into your real life and schedule

## My Promise to You

I'll never ask you to do something I haven't done myself. Every guide, every piece of advice, every encouragement comes from real experience with real people seeking real transformation.

Fasting isn't about proving anything to God. It's about creating space for Him to work in your heart.
